# Worder thread

Worker thread enable you to execute javascript code in seperate thread, allowing to true parallelism.

This is crucial for CPU-intensive tasks that would otherwise block the main thread, impacting the responsiveness of your application.

Workers (threads) are useful for performing CPU-intensive JavaScript operations.

Worker threads can share memory.
They do so by transferring ArrayBuffer instances or sharing SharedArrayBuffer instances.

`For example:`

- Image processing.
- complex calculation.

`Benefits:`

- `Improved prerformance:`
- `Responsiveness:` Maintain a smooth and responsive user experience by preventing the main thread from becoming overloaded.
- `Scalability:` Utilize multiple CPU core effectively to maximize the peformance of your application.
